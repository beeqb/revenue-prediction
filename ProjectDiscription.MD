### Project Discription

In this project, we will predict annual restaurant sales based on objective measurements which is a contest hosted on Kaggle. Training data of 137 restaurants with true sales are given, features include open date, location, city type, and categories. We need to build a model that predicts the sales for new restaurants. There will be 100000 restaurants in the test dataset. The problem itself seems not so hard, however, the ratio of training data and test data is way too low which makes the problem challenging on the RMSR evaluation. We plan to use SVM or Neural Network.
